# Load Global User Rules

## Auto-Loaded Context
@GLOBAL-USER-RULES.md

## Purpose
Load universal coding standards, workflows, and best practices that apply to all projects.

## When to Use
- Starting a new project
- Need workflow reminders
- Establishing standards for a team
- Before major architectural decisions
- Setting up documentation
- Implementing testing strategy

## What's Included

This comprehensive guide covers:

### Planning & Execution Protocol
- Pre-implementation planning checklist
- Approval gates before coding
- Two-chat workflow (Planner vs Builder)

### Documentation Protocol
- SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) templates
- Memory Bank for token optimization
- Pre-coding workflow (User Research → Requirements → Tests → Code)

### Model Selection
- Task-based routing (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus)
- Complexity scoring for auto-routing
- When to use which AI model

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript/JavaScript best practices
- Architecture principles (KISS, YAGNI, DRY)
- Frontend & UI standards (Material Web M3)
- MCP server development standards

### Token Optimization
- Prompt caching strategies (90% savings)
- Parallel tool calls
- Context management
- Batch operations

### Project Workflow
- Step-by-step new project flow
- Testing & refinement process
- Deployment preparation

### Anti-Patterns
- Code anti-patterns to avoid
- Process anti-patterns
- Communication anti-patterns

## Key Principles

**Planning First:**
- Complete entire plan before implementation
- Always ask: "Is this plan complete? May I proceed?"
- Wait for explicit confirmation

**Documentation:**
- Maintain SOP.md for reproducibility
- Update Memory Bank constantly
- Keep it concise for token efficiency

**Quality Over Speed:**
- Use appropriate AI model for task
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow established patterns

## Next Steps

With global rules loaded:
- Follow planning protocol for new features
- Use appropriate documentation templates
- Apply code quality standards
- Optimize for token efficiency
- Reference specific sections as needed
