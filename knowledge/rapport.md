## Tactical Empathy
**Category:** Rapport Building
**One-Line Definition:** The strategic use of empathy to understand and vocalize a subject's emotions and worldview, not to be nice, but to lower defenses and gather intelligence.
**Core Principles:**
• Validation: People stop fighting when they feel understood.
• Emotional Intelligence: Identifying the emotion behind the words allows for deeper influence.
**How It Works:** The operator listens for the emotion driving the subject's words (fear, pride, anger). They then vocalize this emotion back to the subject using a label ("It seems like you're frustrated by..."). This forces the subject to agree ("That's right") and lowers their emotional guard, making them amenable to logic and suggestion.
**Key Terminology:**
• Labeling: Giving a name to the subject's emotion to validate it.
• The "That's Right" Moment: The point where the subject feels fully understood and drops resistance.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Confusing empathy (understanding) with sympathy (feeling sorry for); the operator remains detached but understanding.
**Application Example:** "It sounds like you're worried that this deal will make you look bad to your boss." (Subject: "Exactly.") The objection is now isolated and can be resolved.
