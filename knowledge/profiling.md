## The Lower Eyelid Factor (LEF)
**Category:** Profiling
**One-Line Definition:** A rapid visual profiling method that estimates a person's natural suggestibility by analyzing the static wrinkles in their lower eyelid.
**Core Principles:**
• Muscular Tone: The tone of the orbicularis oculi muscle reflects chronic skepticism vs. openness.
• The Scale: A 1-3 scale (1=Wrinkled/Skeptical, 3=Smooth/Suggestible).
• Biological Marker: This is a physical trait that correlates with the personality trait of agreeableness and hypnotizability.
**How It Works:** The operator looks at the subject's lower eyelid (not the bags, but the lid margin).
• LEF 1: Deep, etched lines or "steps." This person is critical, skeptical, and requires logic/proof. Hard to hypnotize.
• LEF 2: Moderate lines. Average suggestibility.
• LEF 3: Smooth, round, "baby-like" lower lid. This person is highly suggestible, emotional, and prone to fantasy. Easy to hypnotize.
**Key Terminology:**
• Orbicularis Oculi: The muscle surrounding the eye.
• Resting Suggestibility: The baseline level of influence a person will accept before techniques are applied.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Confusing age-related wrinkles (crows feet) with the specific static tension lines of the lower lid.
• Assuming an LEF 1 cannot be influenced (they just need a different approach: Logic/Authority).
**Application Example:** An operator enters a meeting. He spots an LEF 3 (Smooth lid) and an LEF 1 (Wrinkled lid). He directs emotional stories and "visionary" ideas to the LEF 3, but hands data sheets and logical proofs to the LEF 1.
