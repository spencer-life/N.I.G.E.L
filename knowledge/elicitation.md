## Elicitation

Elicitation is the art of obtaining sensitive information without asking direct questions. Instead of interrogating a subject (which raises defenses), the operator uses conversational statements to trigger psychological needs—like the need to correct others, the desire to be recognized, or the urge to reciprocate shared information. The subject volunteers the information freely, often without realizing they've disclosed something sensitive. The core rule: the more sensitive the information, the fewer questions you ask. Elicitation creates connection; interrogation creates barriers.

**Category:** Elicitation
**One-Line Definition:** The art of obtaining sensitive or hidden information from a subject without asking direct questions, often by triggering a psychological need to correct, teach, or share.
**Core Principles:**
• The more sensitive the information, the fewer questions should be asked.
• Elicitation relies on human traits like the need to be recognized, the desire to correct others, and reciprocal exchange.
• It creates a bond/connection, whereas interrogation creates a barrier.
**How It Works:** The operator uses specific conversational statements (not questions) to prompt the subject to volunteer information. Techniques include:
• Provocative Statement: Making a statement that provokes a response ("I bet your job is boring.").
• Naiveté: Feigning ignorance to trigger the subject's need to teach/show off ("I don't know how anyone understands this complex stuff.").
• Citations/Correction: Stating incorrect facts to trigger the need to correct the record ("I heard you guys only make $10 an hour.").
• Informational Altruism: Sharing (fake or real) personal information to trigger reciprocity ("I just broke up with my partner; it's been rough.").
**Key Terminology:**
• Hourglass Method: Placing the sensitive topic in the middle of the conversation to utilize primacy and recency effects (so they forget they told you).
• Bracketing: Giving a range of numbers to get a specific number correction.
• Topic Proximity: The concept that information closer to the subject is guarded more heavily; moving the topic to "third parties" lowers defenses.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Asking direct questions, which triggers defenses.
• Looking too eager or interested when the sensitive information is revealed.
**Application Example:** To find out a competitor's salary structure, an operator says, "I read an article saying people in your industry are barely making $40k a year." (Citation/Correction). The subject responds, "No way, we start at $65k!" The operator gets the data without asking.

## The Hourglass Method
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** An intelligence gathering structure that hides sensitive questions in the middle of a conversation to leverage memory limitations.
**Core Principles:**
• Primacy Effect: People remember the beginning of an interaction most clearly.
• Recency Effect: People remember the end of an interaction most clearly.
**How It Works:** The operator structures a conversation so that innocuous, friendly topics occur at the beginning and the end. The sensitive extraction of information ("the ask") is buried in the middle. Because the brain prioritizes the start and finish of an event for long-term memory storage, the subject is less likely to recall that they divulged sensitive data during the "middle" phase.
The conversation starts wide (general topics), narrows down to the specific target information, and then widens back out to general topics before concluding, resembling the shape of an hourglass.
**Key Terminology:**
• Primacy/Recency: The psychological phenomenon where items at the start and end of a list/event are recalled best.
• Memory Wash: The post-elicitation small talk used to overwrite the short-term memory of the sensitive disclosure.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Ending the conversation immediately after getting the information; this makes the "ask" the Recency event, which the subject will remember clearly.
**Application Example:** An operator wants to know a target's salary. They start by talking about the industry in general (Top). They pivot to a complaint about underpayment and get the target to reveal their number (Middle/Narrow). They immediately transition to a funny story about a bad boss and end with a joke (Bottom).

## Naiveté Technique
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** An elicitation tool where the operator feigns ignorance on a topic the subject prides themselves on, triggering the subject's "need to educate" or "correct the record."
**Core Principles:**
• The Correction Impulse: Humans have a compulsive need to correct wrong information, especially regarding their expertise.
• Ego Gratification: Playing the student makes the subject feel dominant and intelligent (Intelligence/Significance Needs).
**How It Works:** The operator identifies a topic the subject is knowledgeable about. They then make a statement that expresses ignorance or a slight misconception about that topic ("I always thought X was just like Y...").
This triggers the subject to explain the "truth" in great detail. Because they are in "teacher mode," their guard is down, and they often reveal sensitive details to clarify the operator's understanding. It relies on the subject's Intelligence or Significance needs.
**Key Terminology:**
• Correction Impulse: The urge to fix incorrect information presented by others.
• Feigned Ignorance: Deliberately pretending to know less than one does to encourage disclosure.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Acting too stupid; the ignorance must be plausible so the subject feels helpful, not annoyed by incompetence.
**Application Example:** To a software engineer: "I always thought coding was basically just like typing in English but faster." Subject responds: "No way, it's actually... (proceeds to explain proprietary code structure)."
**Related Frameworks:** Elicitation, The Correction Impulse

## Bracketing
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** A technique for extracting specific numbers or data by providing a high and low estimate (a bracket) to force the subject to provide the specific number to "correct" the estimate.
**Core Principles:**
• Correction Impulse: People prefer accuracy over ambiguity.
• Range narrowing: Providing a range feels less intrusive than asking for a specific number.
**How It Works:** Instead of asking, "How much do you make?", which triggers defensiveness, the operator uses a bracket: "I read that people in your department are making between 80k and 120k now."
The subject, feeling the need to place themselves accurately within (or outside) that range for status or accuracy reasons, will often correct with the exact number: "Actually, it's more like 75k," or "Yeah, I'm at the top of that range."
**Key Terminology:**
• Bracketing: Providing a numerical range to elicit a specific digit.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Using a bracket that is wildly offensive or unrealistic, which breaks rapport instead of triggering correction.
**Application Example:** "I heard your company is doing like 12 to 17 deals a month now." Subject: "Actually, it's closer to 9." (Intelligence gathered).
**Related Frameworks:** Elicitation, The Correction Impulse

## Informational Altruism
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** The psychological compulsion to share personal information after someone else has shared personal information with you, based on the law of reciprocity.
**Core Principles:**
• Reciprocity: When given a gift (even a verbal one), humans feel a debt to return it.
• Vulnerability Mirroring: One person's openness triggers the other's openness (mirror neurons).
**How It Works:** The operator volunteers a piece of information (often slightly sensitive or embarrassing) about themselves first. "I'm actually worried I might lose my bonus this year."
This act of "giving" information creates a social pressure for the subject to reciprocate to maintain the balance of the relationship. They will often match the level of intimacy or sensitivity of the disclosure. It is the most effective way to build rapid intimacy.
**Key Terminology:**
• Informational Altruism: Giving info to get info.
• Reciprocity Loop: The cycle of exchange that deepens with every turn.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Sharing something too heavy or traumatic too early, which triggers awkwardness rather than reciprocity.
**Application Example:** "I honestly have no idea what I'm doing with this new software." Subject: "Me neither, I actually deleted the database yesterday by accident."

## Elicitation (General)

Elicitation is obtaining sensitive information without asking questions. You use statements instead of questions—statements that provoke responses, correct misconceptions, or share information to trigger reciprocity. The key psychological mechanism is "The Switch": when subjects start talking without a filter, they feel connection instead of defensiveness, and they keep sharing. Humans have an innate need to correct inaccurate information, downplay compliments, and help the naive—elicitation exploits these impulses through conversation, not interrogation.

**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** The art of obtaining sensitive information without asking direct questions by leveraging social norms and human psychological needs to encourage voluntary disclosure.
**Core Principles:**
• The Switch: When people start talking without a filter, a psychological switch flips that creates connection and opens the "gates" for more information.
• Correction Impulse: Humans have an innate need to correct inaccurate information or "set the record straight".
• Diffidence: People often downplay compliments with explanations, revealing details in the process.
**How It Works:** Elicitation is subtle and conversational. Instead of an interrogation (which raises defenses), the operator uses statements to provoke responses. It relies on the compound effect: as the subject shares a little, they feel comfortable sharing more. It exploits specific human traits, such as the desire to be recognized, the need to correct others, and the urge to offer advice to the naive.
**Key Terminology:**
• The Attribution Error: (In this context) Assuming a behavior (like sharing secrets) is a fixed trait rather than a response to the operator's elicitation skills.
• Elicitation: Obtaining info without asking questions.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Asking too many direct questions (interrogating), which makes the subject feel pried upon rather than engaged.
**Application Example:** Instead of asking "How much do you make?", an operator says, "I read that your department got a huge pay bump to $45/hour." The subject corrects them: "No way, we're still at $28." The information is gained without a direct ask.

## Provocative Statements
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** The use of a statement (rather than a question) designed to provoke a specific response, explanation, or correction from the subject.
**Core Principles:**
• Statement vs. Question: Statements feel like sharing; questions feel like taking.
• The Urge to Respond: A provocative statement creates a psychological vacuum that the subject feels compelled to fill.
**How It Works:** The operator makes a declarative statement about the subject, their job, or their situation. For example, "You must be exhausted." The subject will naturally want to validate or correct this assessment. In doing so, they provide the "why" and "how"—the details the operator is looking for. This can be stacked; using multiple provocative statements in a row digs deeper.
**Key Terminology:**
• Provocative Statement: A claim made to trigger an explanatory response.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Making the statement too offensive or aggressive, which causes the subject to shut down rather than explain.
**Application Example:** Operator: "I bet this is a great place to work." Cashier: "It’s not that bad, but we have to take extra shifts to fill the back with stock we won't sell. It's sad." (Information revealed about inventory mismanagement).
**Related Frameworks:** Cold Reading, Barnum Statements

## Flattery (Diffidence)
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** Using compliments to trigger the subject's "diffidence" (modesty), causing them to explain away the praise by revealing the struggles, details, or team members involved.
**Core Principles:**
• Diffidence: The social reflex to downplay a compliment to appear humble.
• Explanation as Defense: To prove they aren't arrogant, people explain why the success happened, revealing process details.
**How It Works:** The operator compliments the subject on a specific achievement or trait. "You really led that project single-handedly." The subject, wanting to be humble, corrects the operator: "Well, it wasn't just me. The engineering team in Austin did the heavy lifting because we had that setback in May." The operator gains intel on the team and the setback.
**Key Terminology:**
• Diffidence: The instinct to deflect praise.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Using flattery that sounds sarcastic or manipulative; it must sound genuine to trigger the modesty reflex.
**Application Example:** "This is the cleanest Uber I've ever been in!" Driver: "Thanks, I try, but it's hard when I'm picking up drunk people at the hospital all night." (Reveals work habits and location).
**Related Frameworks:** Ego Suspension, Rapport

## Eliciting Complaints
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** A technique that bonds through shared negativity or validation, encouraging the subject to vent frustrations and reveal internal problems or weaknesses.
**Core Principles:**
• Venting is Freeing: People love to complain to strangers because it is safe and cathartic.
• Negative Bonding: Shared dislike is often a stronger bonding agent than shared positive interests.
**How It Works:** The operator uses a provocative statement or citation to validate a potential negative aspect of the subject's life (e.g., "I bet they don't pay you enough for this"). Once the subject starts complaining, they reveal operational details, morale issues, and personal vulnerabilities. This effectively identifies their "Negative GHT" (Gestural Hemispheric Tendency) side as well.
**Key Terminology:**
• Comisery: Bonding through shared misery.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Trying to solve the complaint. The goal is to validate and encourage more venting, not to fix the problem.
**Application Example:** "I bet the hours here are tough." Employee: "It's brutal. They change the schedule every week, so I have to rearrange daycare constantly." (Reveals scheduling protocols and family status).

## Citations
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** Referencing a third-party source (news, article, rumor) to introduce a topic, prompting the subject to correct or verify the information based on their insider knowledge.
**Core Principles:**
• Third-Party Distance: It is safer to discuss what "someone else said" than to ask a direct question.
• Correction Impulse: If the cited information is wrong, the subject will instinctively fix it.
**How It Works:** The operator says, "I read an article that said [Topic X] is happening." If the info is right, the subject confirms and elaborates. If it's wrong, the subject corrects it with the truth. This is useful for getting specific dates, numbers, or plans without asking "When is X happening?".
**Key Terminology:**
• The Citation: The external source (real or invented) used to introduce the topic.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Citing a source the subject knows intimately and respects, which might make them suspicious if the info is fake. Use vague sources like "the internet" or "an article".
**Application Example:** "I read online that the new bank branch is opening in November." Employee: "Actually, it's going to be sooner. It's set for June."

## Verbal Reflection
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** Repeating the subject's words or the general theme of their statement back to them to encourage elaboration without asking questions.
**Core Principles:**
• The Mirror Effect: Hearing one's own words builds connection and signals active listening.
• The Void: Repeating a word and pausing creates a silence the subject feels compelled to fill by explaining further.
**How It Works:** Method 1 (FBI Mirror): Repeat the last 3 words or the critical word of their sentence as a question. Subject: "It was a rough night." Operator: "Rough night?" Subject: "Yeah, the police came..." Method 2 (Theme Repetition): Summarize the emotional theme. "Sounds like a long time." This prompts the subject to expand on the details.
**Key Terminology:**
• Verbal Mirror: Repeating the last 1-3 words.
• Theme Repetition: Paraphrasing the core sentiment.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Overusing it until it sounds robotic or mocking. It should be interspersed with other techniques.
**Application Example:** Subject: "I tried to stop them but they said no." Operator: "Said no?" Subject: "Yeah, they kept throwing the drugs out the window."
**Related Frameworks:** Active Listening, FBI Negotiation

## Naiveté
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** Feigning ignorance on a topic the subject is knowledgeable about to trigger their "need to educate," causing them to explain details they would otherwise protect.
**Core Principles:**
• Ego Gratification: Being the teacher makes the subject feel intelligent and dominant (Intelligence/Significance Needs).
• The Correction Impulse: People love to fix a misconception.
**How It Works:** The operator expresses interest in a topic but admits total ignorance, or makes a naive statement about how it works. "I always thought coding was just like typing." The subject, eager to show off their expertise, explains the intricate details of the process, revealing technical or proprietary info.
**Key Terminology:**
• Feigned Ignorance: Pretending to know less than you do.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Acting so stupid that it becomes annoying or unbelievable. The ignorance must be plausible and accompanied by fascination.
**Application Example:** "I barely know how to use Excel. I bet your financial models are just simple addition, right?" Employee: "No way, the formulas I wrote are incredibly complex. I actually linked the..." (Proceeds to explain proprietary financial structure).

## Criticism
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** Using a critical statement about a third party, organization, or situation to provoke the subject into defending it or providing "insider" context.
**Core Principles:**
• Defense Mechanism: When something a subject identifies with is criticized, they will provide data to defend it.
• Justification: Criticism creates a need to explain why things are the way they are.
**How It Works:** The operator makes a negative comment about the subject's company or a mutual acquaintance. "I hear those cars don't last long." The subject counters with specific data to prove the criticism wrong. "Actually, they have a track record of 200k miles."
**Key Terminology:**
• Indirect Criticism: Criticizing the context, not the person directly.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Criticizing the subject directly, which causes defensiveness and shuts down rapport. The criticism must be directed at the circumstance or organization.
**Application Example:** "It's a shame so many people are fake these days." Subject: "I know! That's why I always try to be open..." (Subject commits to openness identity).
**Related Frameworks:** Negative Dissociation, Cognitive Dissonance

## Disbelief
**Category:** 11. Elicitation (Techniques & triggers)
**One-Line Definition:** Expressing skepticism or doubt about a claim to provoke the subject into providing proof or excessive detail to convince the operator.
**Core Principles:**
• Need for Validation: Humans want to be believed.
• Oversharing as Proof: When doubted, people dump data to prove their point.
**How It Works:** The operator reacts to a statement with doubt. "No way, I don't believe that." The subject will then go to great lengths to prove it is true, often revealing sensitive details they wouldn't have shared otherwise. "It's true! Look, here is the email..."
**Key Terminology:**
• Feigned Skepticism: Pretending not to believe to elicit proof.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Being aggressive with the disbelief; it should be framed as "I'm shocked" rather than "You are a liar".
**Application Example:** Subject: "We are profitable." Operator: "There is no way you guys are making a profit with just online sales." Subject: "Actually, we just wrapped this quarter with three million in gross."
