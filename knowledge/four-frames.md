## The "Those Types" Callout
**Category:** Influence / Frame Control
**One-Line Definition:** A defensive framing technique used to shut down rude or challenging behavior by labeling it as a low-status trait that the subject surely doesn't possess.
**Core Principles:**
• People desperately want to avoid negative labels (Negative Dissociation).
• It re-establishes the operator's authority as a non-reactive observer.
• It uses a "Father Frame" (disappointed but kind).
**How It Works:** When someone challenges the operator or acts rudely, the operator does not fight back. Instead, they smile warmly and say, "You know, I know you pretty well, and I know you aren't one of those types of people who acts like that. Is something wrong?"
This forces the subject to either:
1. Admit they are "that type" (socially damaging).
2. Apologize and align with the operator’s positive view of them (Compliance).
It leverages the subject's desire for social approval and consistency.
**Key Terminology:**
• Moral Positioning: Placing oneself above the fray by judging the behavior, not the person.
• Negative Dissociation: Distancing the subject from a negative group ("Those types").
• Father Frame: The archetypal frame of a kind, firm, correcting authority figure.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Delivering the line with anger or sarcasm (triggers a fight).
• Using it on someone who truly doesn't care about social norms (e.g., a drunk person).
**Application Example:** A client is yelling at a consultant. The consultant pauses, smiles gently, and says, "John, I know you're a professional, and you're definitely not one of those guys who screams to get his way. That's beneath you. Let's start over." John, not wanting to be seen as "one of those guys," calms down immediately.

## The Mental Frame
**Category:** 7. Four Frames
**One-Line Definition:** The internal definition a person creates for a social interaction, comprised of four specific corners (Expectation, Beliefs, Perception, Definition) that determine who controls the meaning and context of the situation.
**Core Principles:**
• Frame Dominance: The person with the strongest frame assumes control over the meaning of the interaction; the weaker frame is absorbed unconsciously.
• Hierarchy of Subversion: To control a frame, one must subvert the corners in a specific order: Expectation first (easiest), followed by Beliefs, Perception, and finally Definition (hardest).
**How It Works:** Every social interaction involves two frames battling for dominance. When an operator enters a situation, they must "Large-Frame" the interaction—growing their frame to encompass the subject's rather than crushing it. This is done by systematically dismantling the four corners of the subject's frame.
The process begins by breaking Expectation (interrupting the script). Once the subject cannot predict the outcome, the operator challenges Beliefs (assumptions about status/hierarchy). With beliefs shaken, the subject's Perception (view of current reality) destabilizes. Finally, the Definition (rules and facts of the situation) changes to match the operator's will.
**Key Terminology:**
• Large-Framing: The collaborative approach of expanding one's frame to include the other person, creating safety and compliance without conflict.
• Competitive vs. Collaborative: The two mindsets of framing; competitive seeks status/power, while collaborative seeks mutual elevation (leadership).
**Common Mistakes:**
• Attempting to "assert" dominance or force a frame, which brings the conflict into the conscious mind and triggers resistance.
• Focusing on status and hierarchy, which signals insecurity and weakens the frame.
**Application Example:** A client tries to push a consultant into a "vendor" frame (Expectation: they will pitch me; Belief: I am the prize). The consultant breaks the script by asking a hard qualifying question (breaking Expectation). They act with total indifference to the sale (breaking Beliefs regarding status). The client now views the consultant as a peer or expert (Perception shift) and accepts the new reality that they need the consultant (Definition shift).

## Expectation (Corner 1)
**Category:** 7. Four Frames
**One-Line Definition:** The first corner of the Mental Frame, representing the subject's prediction of what is likely to happen in an interaction based on their internal scripts and past experiences.
**Core Principles:**
• Predictability: Humans rely on life scripts to save cognitive energy; they expect standard behaviors in standard settings (e.g., ordering coffee).
• Novelty Vulnerability: Expectation is the easiest corner to subvert because the brain automatically focuses on anything that breaks a pattern (novelty).
**How It Works:** The subject enters an interaction with a script: "This is a sales call, so he will pitch me," or "I am the boss, so he will submit." To subvert this corner, the operator must do something that creates a "prediction error."
By introducing novelty or breaking the expected script immediately, the operator forces the subject's brain to stop its autopilot and pay attention. The subject says internally, "Whoa, this is different than other times, I need to pay attention." This crack in the frame allows the operator to begin inserting their own reality.
**Key Terminology:**
• Life Script: An automated behavioral pattern learned through experience (e.g., how to act in an elevator).
• Prediction Error: The moment the brain realizes reality does not match its internal model/expectation.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Behaving exactly as the subject predicts (e.g., a salesperson acting "salesy"), which reinforces their frame and keeps their critical factor active.
**Application Example:** A subject expects a subordinate to be nervous (Expectation). The subordinate walks in slowly, sits back comfortably, and asks, "So, what can I do for you?" The expectation is shattered, creating immediate focus.
**Related Frameworks:** Script-Hacking, Novelty

## Beliefs (Corner 2)
**Category:** 7. Four Frames
**One-Line Definition:** The second corner of the Mental Frame, representing what the subject believes to be true about the situation, specifically regarding social hierarchy, status, and their assumptions about the operator.
**Core Principles:**
• Relative Status: Beliefs are often comparisons: "Am I higher or lower status than this person?"
• Assumption of Authority: People unconsciously assign authority levels based on non-verbal signals before words are spoken.
**How It Works:** This corner contains the subject's assumptions about who is in charge. To subvert it, the operator must behave in a way that contradicts the subject's status assessment. This is done by ensuring behavior is "above their expectations without resorting to overpowering them."
When the operator displays higher authority traits (MACCI) than the subject believed they possessed, the subject's belief system regarding the social hierarchy of the interaction crumbles. They can no longer assume they are the alpha or the decision-maker.
**Key Terminology:**
• Status Assessment: The unconscious scanning of another person to determine social rank.
• Subversion: The act of undermining the subject's established reality.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Trying to prove status through arrogance or loudness (Posturing), which actually signals low status/insecurity to the subject's subconscious.
**Application Example:** A subject believes they can dominate the operator because they are older/richer. The operator remains completely non-reactive, speaks slowly, and shows zero need for validation. The subject's belief ("I am the dominant one") is subverted by the operator's reality.
**Related Frameworks:** Authority Triangle, Status, MACCI Traits

## Perception (Corner 3)
**Category:** 7. Four Frames
**One-Line Definition:** The third corner of the Mental Frame, representing what the subject believes to be "the truth" about themselves and the current situation through their own subjective lens.
**Core Principles:**
• Subjective Truth: Perception is not fact; it is the subject's view of the facts (e.g., "I am smart," "I am in control").
• Dependency on Beliefs: Once Expectations and Beliefs are broken, Perception has no foundation and becomes malleable.
**How It Works:** This corner houses the subject's confidence and self-assessment ("I'm not a pushover," "I know what's going on"). When the operator has successfully subverted Expectation (by being unpredictable) and Beliefs (by showing higher status), the subject can no longer trust their perception of the scenario.
They begin to doubt their "facts." They stop thinking, "I am in charge," and start thinking, "Maybe I don't know what's happening." This state of doubt allows the operator to replace the subject's perception with a new one.
**Key Terminology:**
• The Lens: The internal filter through which a subject interprets reality; the operator's goal is to change the lens.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Attacking a subject's perception directly (e.g., "You aren't in charge") before subverting expectation and belief; this causes defensiveness.
**Application Example:** A security guard perceives himself as the authority (Perception). The operator breaks the script (Expectation) and displays high-status behavior (Beliefs). The guard's perception shifts from "I am the authority" to "I am assisting a VIP."

## Definition (Corner 4)
**Category:** 7. Four Frames
**One-Line Definition:** The fourth and final corner of the Mental Frame, representing the "absolute truths" or hard facts of the situation (rules, roles, employment) that give the subject permission to behave in certain ways.
**Core Principles:**
• Hardest to Subvert: Definitions are anchored in logic and external validation (e.g., "I am the CEO," "This is illegal").
• Psychological Permission: Definitions provide the license for behavior; changing the definition changes what behavior is allowed.
**How It Works:** Definitions are the "facts" governing the interaction. However, when Expectation, Beliefs, and Perception have collapsed, even definitions become fluid. A subject who defines themselves as "the decision maker" may redefine themselves as "a student" in the presence of a master teacher (operator).
The operator creates a new definition of reality (e.g., "We are not buyer and seller; we are partners solving a problem"). Because the subject's previous frame has collapsed, they accept this new definition to resolve the psychological tension.
**Key Terminology:**
• Contextual Reality: The agreed-upon rules of the interaction.
• The Collapse: The moment the subject's frame disintegrates, and they adopt the operator's frame to maintain social stability.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Trying to change the Definition (facts/roles) without first dismantling the psychological corners (Expectation/Belief/Perception).
**Application Example:** A police officer defines the situation as "Interrogating a suspect." The operator uses the Four Frames to shift the dynamic until the officer accepts the new definition: "Two professionals solving a misunderstanding."

## The Father Frame
**Category:** 7. Four Frames
**One-Line Definition:** One of the five "winning frames," characterized by amused mastery, benevolent authority, and a complete lack of reactivity to challenges.
**Core Principles:**
• Amused Mastery: Viewing challenges as "cute" or "interesting" rather than threatening.
• Collaborative Dominance: Assuming "custody" of the room for the benefit of others, not for ego.
**How It Works:** When challenged, the operator adopts the persona of a wise father figure. They do not get angry or defensive. They treat the challenger with kindness and patience, as if dealing with a child having a tantrum.
This frame creates a massive status gap. By refusing to engage in a power struggle, the operator demonstrates that they are so far above the challenger that the challenge is irrelevant. This usually causes the challenger to de-escalate or look foolish to the group.
**Key Terminology:**
• Amused Mastery: The internal state of finding a challenge amusing rather than insulting.
• Custody: Taking responsibility for the emotional state of the room.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Being patronizing or arrogant; the Father Frame must be rooted in genuine warmth and stability (Composure), not disdain.
**Application Example:** A colleague tries to insult the operator in a meeting. The operator smiles warmly, pauses, and says, "You seem really passionate about this today, Dave. I love that energy," then continues with the presentation.
**Related Frameworks:** Authority Triangle, Composure

## The Child Frame
**Category:** 7. Four Frames
**One-Line Definition:** A frame used primarily by those lacking true authority, characterized by "testing" behavior, questioning credibility, and poking holes in others' frames to gain temporary control.
**Core Principles:**
• Testing: The child frame seeks to find weakness in others to feel safe or dominant.
• Non-Reactivity: A variation of this frame involves ignoring social pressure or pretending not to hear, forcing others to repeat themselves (submission).
**How It Works:** People in the Child Frame constantly challenge others ("Why should we listen to you?", "Is that really true?"). They do not have a strong frame of their own, so they exist by subverting others.
When an operator encounters this frame, they should recognize it as a sign of weakness/insecurity in the subject. The operator counters this not by fighting, but by using the Father Frame to treat the "test" as a cute behavior, neutralizing the attack.
**Key Terminology:**
• Frame-Poking: Small attacks designed to test the strength of another's reality.
• The Test: A behavioral check to see if a leader is congruent.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Taking the Child Frame's bait and arguing logic; this validates their frame and lowers the operator's status.
**Application Example:** A subject asks, "Do you even know what you're doing?" (Child/Testing). The operator laughs comfortably (Father Frame) and says, "That's a fair question," before moving on without defending themselves.
