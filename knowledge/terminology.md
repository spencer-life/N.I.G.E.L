## The 3-Step Diagnostic Process
**Category:** 27. Terminology (Glossary terms)
**One-Line Definition:** A troubleshooting framework used to identify why a specific influence attempt failed by analyzing Observation, Communication, and Self-Management.
**Core Principles:**
• Root Cause Analysis: Failure is rarely about the "technique" and usually about the operator's state or calibration.
• The Triangle of Failure: Failures fall into Observation (missed cues), Communication (poor delivery), or Self-Management (lack of authority/composure).
**How It Works:** When a technique fails, the operator asks:
1. Observation: Did I miss a baseline behavior or a need? (ACSS: Skills).
2. Communication: Did I deliver the script wrong? (ACSS: Social Skills).
3. Self-Management: Did I lack confidence or composure? (ACSS: Authority/Comfort).
By pinpointing the specific failure point, the operator can correct the specific deficit rather than abandoning the technique.
**Key Terminology:**
• ACSS Framework: Authority, Comfort, Social, Skill – the four pillars of operator competence.
**Application Example:** An operator fails to get a number. Diagnosis:
1. Observation: Did I see she was busy? (Yes).
2. Communication: Did I use the script? (Yes).
3. Self-Management: Was I nervous? (Yes). Solution: The failure was Self-Management (Comfort), not the script.

## Glossary of Terms
**Category:** Terminology (Glossary terms)
1. **Agentic Shift:** The psychological state where an individual cedes responsibility for their actions to an authority figure.
2. **Autopilot:** The brain's default mode (System 1) where scripts and habits run without conscious thought.
3. **Behavioral Entrainment:** The process of leading a subject's physical movements to induce psychological compliance.
4. **BTE (Behavioral Table of Elements):** A periodic table of 100+ gestures and behaviors used for profiling and deception detection.
5. **Confirming Gesture:** A body language signal that validates the meaning of a spoken statement or another gesture.
6. **Critical Factor:** The mental filter that rejects new information; must be bypassed for hypnosis or influence to work.
7. **DACC (Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex):** The "Air Traffic Controller" of the brain that filters focus and detects conflict.
8. **Deception Rating Scale (DRS):** A 1-4 scoring system for behaviors on the BTE to calculate the likelihood of deception.
9. **Double Bind:** A linguistic trap offering two choices that both lead to the operator's desired outcome.
10. **Embedded Command:** A hidden instruction within a sentence marked by tonality or pauses to bypass the conscious mind.
11. **Fractionation:** A hypnosis technique of taking a subject in and out of trance to deepen the state.
12. **Gestural Hemispheric Tendency (GHT):** The direction a person looks/gestures when accessing positive vs. negative memories.
13. **Ideomotor Response:** Unconscious physical movements (finger twitches) that signal internal mental processing.
14. **Informational Altruism:** The compulsion to share information after receiving information (reciprocity).
15. **Limbic System:** The emotional center of the brain responsible for survival instincts, bonding, and "gut feelings".
16. **MACCI:** The acronym for the five external Authority traits: Movement, Appearance, Confidence, Connection, Intent.
17. **Negative Dissociation:** Linguistically separating a subject from a negative trait by attributing it to "others".
18. **Pattern Interrupt:** A sudden behavior or statement that disrupts a running mental script, creating a moment of suggestibility.
19. **Proxemics:** The study of personal space and how distance affects communication and authority.
20. **Somnambulism:** A deep state of hypnosis where the subject is highly suggestible and may not remember the session.
21. **Trans-Derivational Search (TDS):** The brain's rapid internal search for meaning when confused, creating a focus window.
22. **Tripwires:** Specific behavioral cues that automatically trigger the brain's recognition of Authority
