## The Decision Map (The 6 Filters)
**Category:** Decision Map (Decision filters)
**One-Line Definition:** A profiling model that categorizes the six subconscious filters through which individuals process choices, determining whether they will buy, agree, or comply.
**Core Principles:**
• The Steering Wheel: While Needs drive behavior, the Decision Map steers the specific choice (e.g., which car to buy to fulfill the need for Significance).
• Adjacent Bleed: People often exhibit their primary style and traits from the style immediately next to it on the map (e.g., Deviance and Novelty).
**How It Works:** Every decision is filtered through a specific internal question. The operator identifies the subject's style and frames the proposal to answer that question:
1. Deviance: "Will this help me stand out or break norms?" (Focus: Uniqueness/Rebellion).
2. Novelty: "Is this noticeably new?" (Focus: Early adoption/Innovation).
3. Social: "Will this connect me with people?" (Focus: Perception/Interaction).
4. Conformity: "Is this what my group is doing?" (Focus: Safety/Tradition).
5. Investment: "What is the ROI?" (Focus: Long-term value/Return).
6. Necessity: "Is this absolutely needed?" (Focus: Utility/Function).
**Key Terminology:**
• The Internal Question: The subconscious query a subject asks before committing to an action.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Pitching "New/Novelty" features to a "Conformity" or "Investment" style; this triggers an automatic rejection because it fails their internal filter.
**Application Example:** To a Conformity style subject: "Most people in your industry are moving to this standard to stay safe." To a Deviance style subject: "This isn't for everyone; it's for the few who want to disrupt the industry standard".
