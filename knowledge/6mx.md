## The Six-Minute X-Ray (6MX)
**Category:** 6MX/Human Needs/Compass/Decision Map
**One-Line Definition:** A rapid behavioral profiling system designed to identify a person's psychological makeup—Needs, Decision style, Values, and linguistic patterns—within six minutes of conversation.
**Core Principles:**
• People reveal their deepest drives and fears unconsciously through everyday language.
• Profiling allows the operator to tailor communication to match the subject's internal reality.
• It moves beyond body language to analyze why a person behaves the way they do.
**How It Works:** The 6MX system requires the operator to listen and observe for specific markers during conversation. The operator identifies:
1. The Needs Map: What the person seeks socially (e.g., Significance, Approval).
2. The Decision Map: How the person filters choices (e.g., Novelty, Investment).
3. The Values Map: The ultimate goals driving their life (e.g., Freedom, Connection).
4. Linguistic Patterns: Pronoun usage (Self/Team/Others), Sensory Preference (Visual/Audio/Kinesthetic), and Adjectives.
By combining these data points, the operator creates a "Behavior Compass"—a profile that predicts how the subject will react and what specific language will influence them most effectively.
**Key Terminology:**
• Behavior Compass: The visual tool/chart used to map out a subject’s profile (Needs, Decisions, Values, etc.).
• Needs Map: A categorization of social drives (Significance, Approval, Acceptance, Intelligence, Pity, Strength).
• Decision Map: A categorization of decision-making filters (Deviance, Novelty, Social, Conformity, Investment, Necessity).
• Linguistic Harvesting: The act of listening for and collecting specific words (adjectives, pronouns) the subject uses.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Projecting one's own values or needs onto the subject.
• Stopping at the "what" (body language) without digging for the "why" (Needs/Values).
**Application Example:** An operator meets a client who talks about their "exclusive" club membership and uses words like "elite" and "top-tier." The operator identifies a Significance Need and a Deviance Decision style. The operator adjusts their pitch to emphasize how "rare" and "game-changing" their proposal is, rather than talking about safety or popularity.

## The Four Laws of Behavior
**Category:** 6. 6MX (Six-Minute X-Ray)
**One-Line Definition:** The philosophical "filter" or lens through which a 6MX operator views all human beings to maintain composure and eliminate judgment.
**Core Principles:**
• Universal Frailty: Acknowledging that everyone is struggling and insecure prevents the operator from being intimidated.
• The Mask: Understanding that social behavior is a curated persona, not the real person.
**How It Works:** The operator memorizes and internalizes four specific laws to filter their perception of others:
1. Everyone is suffering and insecure: The brain is a threat-detection machine; everyone is fighting a hard battle.
2. Everyone is wearing a mask: People present a curated image to gain social acceptance; the operator must look behind it.
3. Everyone is a drug addict: Everyone is addicted to specific neuropeptides (Needs) like dopamine or oxytocin and behaves in ways to trigger them.
4. Everyone wants to be the hero: People view themselves as the protagonist of their own movie; the operator must treat them as such.
**Key Terminology:**
• The Fourth Lens: The perspective of seeing the "reasons" behind behavior (e.g., seeing the hurt child inside an angry adult) rather than reacting to the behavior itself.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Getting caught up in the "content" of what a person is saying or doing (e.g., getting angry at an insult) rather than analyzing the "context" of why they are doing it (e.g., they need Significance).
**Application Example:** An operator meets an arrogant CEO who is rude. Instead of reacting with anger, the operator applies the Laws: "He is insecure (Law 1) and wearing a mask of strength (Law 2) because he is addicted to the feeling of Significance (Law 3)." The operator then feeds the need for Significance, and the CEO becomes compliant.

## Quadrant Analysis
**Category:** 6. 6MX (Six-Minute X-Ray)
**One-Line Definition:** A simplified training method for 6MX where the operator draws a cross on a post-it note to track four specific behavioral indicators in real-time.
**Core Principles:**
• Cognitive Load Management: Trying to track everything at once leads to failure; focusing on four specific traits builds unconscious competence.
• Real-Time Tracking: Moving from "knowing" the theory to "seeing" the behavior live.
**How It Works:** The operator draws a plus sign (+), creating four quadrants. They label each quadrant with a specific behavior they want to track during a conversation. Common configurations include:
1. Df: Digital Flexion/Extension (Hand movements indicating stress or comfort).
2. Br: Blink Rate (Speeding up or slowing down).
3. Sh: Shoulder movement (Shrugs or retreat).
4. Lp: Lip movement (Compression or object insertion). During the interaction, the operator marks the quadrants with arrows or letters (e.g., 'F' for Flexion) and circles them when they identify the specific topic that caused the reaction.
**Key Terminology:**
• IO (Initial Observation): The baseline reading taken at the start of the interaction.
• The Circle: A mark made on the quadrant when the operator successfully identifies the cause of the behavior.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Trying to track complex psychological traits (Values) before mastering physical tells (Blink Rate/Shoulders); the physical tells are the "check engine lights" for the deeper psychology.
**Application Example:** In a meeting, the operator notes "Br" (Blink Rate) increased when "budget" was mentioned. They circle the arrow in the Br quadrant. They now know "budget" is a stressor without asking a single question.

## Linguistic Harvesting
**Category:** 6. 6MX (Six-Minute X-Ray)
**One-Line Definition:** The process of analyzing a subject's word choices—specifically Pronouns, Sensory words, and Adjectives—to decode their neural wiring and self-view.
**Core Principles:**
• Pronouns Reveal Focus: "I/Me" indicates self-focus; "We/Us" indicates tribal focus; "They/Them" indicates external focus.
• Adjectives Reveal Values: The words a person uses to describe others (positive or negative) reveal what they value or fear in themselves.
**How It Works:** The operator listens "between the lines" for three specific data points:
1. Pronouns (PRN): Does the subject view themselves as an individual (Self), a leader/member (Team), or an observer (Others)?
2. Sensory Preference (SNS): Does the subject use Visual ("I see"), Auditory ("I hear"), or Kinesthetic ("I feel") language? This dictates how the operator should pitch information.
3. Adjectives (ADJ): What specific words does the subject use to praise or criticize? (e.g., "That's genius" vs. "That's stupid"). The operator mirrors these exact words back to build deep rapport.
**Key Terminology:**
• Echoing: The technique of repeating the subject's specific adjectives back to them to create a sense of being "felt" or understood.
• Sensory Mismatch: Using visual language with a kinesthetic person, which causes a disconnect.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Paraphrasing instead of using the exact adjective. If the subject says "fantastic," saying "great" breaks the connection; you must use "fantastic."
**Application Example:** A subject says, "I feel like we are moving too slow." The operator analyzes: Kinesthetic (feel), Team (we), Negative Adjective (slow). The operator responds: "I get the feeling that our group needs to pick up the pace." (Matching all three linguistic markers).

## The "Wait Till The End" Fallacy
**Category:** 6. 6MX (Six-Minute X-Ray)
**One-Line Definition:** The erroneous tendency in sales and interrogation to wait until the end of a presentation to ask for objections, rather than spotting resistance cues in real-time.
**Core Principles:**
• Real-Time Diagnostics: Objections manifest physically (blink rate, lip compression) the moment they occur in the mind.
• Pre-emptive Handling: Addressing an objection immediately when the behavior is spotted prevents it from calcifying into a "No."
**How It Works:** Amateurs deliver a pitch and then ask, "So, what do you think?" 6MX Operators scan for "Red Lights" (Lip Compression, Shoulder Shrugs, Blink Rate spikes) during the pitch. If the operator mentions "Price" and the subject's lips compress (stress), the operator stops and addresses it immediately: "I know the price can be a concern for some..."
**Key Terminology:**
• Red Lights: Behavioral indicators of stress or disagreement (e.g., Digital Flexion, Throat Clearing).
• Green Lights: Behavioral indicators of comfort or agreement (e.g., Digital Extension, Head Nodding).
**Common Mistakes:**
• Seeing a stress indicator (Red Light) and continuing to talk; this ignores the subject's internal reality and breaks rapport.
**Application Example:** While presenting a contract, the operator points to the "liability" clause. The client rubs their neck (pacifying behavior). The operator immediately stops and says, "That clause looks standard, but it can be a bit intimidating. Let's walk through it." The objection is resolved before the client even speaks it.

## The Fuzzy Compass
**Category:** 6. 6MX (Six-Minute X-Ray)
**One-Line Definition:** A profiling technique used when specific data is unavailable, where the operator selects the most likely primary trait and a "backup" secondary trait to allow for flexible influence.
**Core Principles:**
• Probabilistic Profiling: You rarely get 100% data; you must operate on high-probability estimates.
• Plus-Minus Two: For every primary trait identified, the operator prepares for the neighboring traits on the map.
**How It Works:** If an operator cannot pinpoint the exact "Need" of a subject, they look at the subject's behavior and make an educated guess (e.g., "He seems like Strength/Power"). They then mark a "Fuzzy Compass" by selecting Strength as the primary, but also noting "Significance" (a related need) as a backup. They formulate their language to target Strength, but keep Significance-based appeals ready in case the first attempt fails to land.
**Key Terminology:**
• Fuzzy Compass: A working hypothesis profile that is updated as new data comes in.
• Backup Trait: The secondary likely psychological driver used if the primary profile is incorrect.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Freezing or refusing to act because the profile isn't "perfect" yet. Action creates data; a fuzzy profile is better than no profile.
**Application Example:** An operator meets a loud, flashy dresser. They guess "Significance" (Need). They try a Significance compliment ("You stand out"). If the subject doesn't react, the operator pivots to the Fuzzy/Backup trait, perhaps "Deviance" (Decision), and tries a new angle ("You like breaking the rules").

## The Values Map
**Category:** 6. 6MX (Six-Minute X-Ray)
**One-Line Definition:** The third and deepest layer of the 6MX profiling system that identifies a subject's ultimate long-term drivers and life goals, often stemming from what they felt was lacking during their developmental years.
**Core Principles:**
• Values Arise from Lack: People develop values based on what was missing in childhood or what currently remains out of reach; we value what we do not fully possess.
• The "Why" Behind Behavior: While the Needs Map dictates how a person wants to feel in a social interaction, and the Decision Map dictates what choice they make, the Values Map explains why they are doing it all.
**How It Works:** The operator listens for "end-result" topics in conversation—such as retirement plans, ideal job descriptions, or what the subject would do if they won the lottery. These discussions reveal which of the six core values is driving the subject's life trajectory:
1. Connection: Prioritizes family, tribe, and relationships above all else.
2. Information: Seeks resources, data, and access to "the inside" to feel successful.
3. Recognition: Desires to be seen, acknowledged, and famous for their accomplishments.
4. Experience: Values travel, sensations, and living a "full life" over material goods.
5. Freedom: Seeks autonomy; the ability to do anything at any time without restriction.
6. Growth: Focuses on constant self-improvement, education, and avoiding stagnation.
By identifying the specific Value, the operator can frame their proposal or request as the "vehicle" that delivers the subject to their ultimate life goal.
**Key Terminology:**
• End-Result Topics: Conversations about the distant future or ideal states (e.g., retirement) that bypass daily stressors and reveal core drivers.
• The "Box": The psychological concept that values are rarely fully satisfied; if a person achieves a value, they often subconsciously build a new "box" or barrier to overcome to continue the pursuit.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Confusing Values (Long-term goals) with Needs (Immediate social chemicals). A person might Need "Pity" in the moment to feel a chemical rush, but Value "Strength/Growth" in the long term.
• Assuming a person values what they have. Often, a wealthy person values "Connection" because they have money but lack friends; values usually point to the void, not the asset.
**Application Example:** A potential client says, "I just want to get this deal done so I can finally stop answering to a board of directors and do what I want."
• Profile: The operator identifies the Value as Freedom.
• Action: Instead of pitching the deal's profitability (Investment), the operator says: "This deal is the leash-cutter. It’s the key that unlocks the door to you finally calling your own shots."
