## Behavioral Table of Elements (BTE)
**Category:** Body-Language
**One-Line Definition:** A periodic table-style system used to categorize, rate, and analyze human behaviors based on their level of stress, deception likelihood, and psychological meaning.
**Core Principles:**
• Behavior must be analyzed in clusters, not in isolation.
• Behaviors are rated on a Deception Rating Scale (DRS) from 1.0 to 4.0.
• A total score of 11 or more points within a specific Q&A cluster indicates a high likelihood of deception or extreme stress.
**How It Works:** The BTE organizes gestures and physiological responses (elements) into a grid. The vertical axis represents body regions (Head to Feet), while the horizontal axis represents the stress/deception level (low to high). Each "element" (cell) contains specific data: a symbol (e.g., "Ac" for Arm Cross), a name, confirming gestures, conflicting behaviors, and a deception rating.
An operator uses the BTE to profile a subject in real-time or post-mortem (video analysis). By noting behaviors exhibited during specific questions or topics, the operator calculates a score. High scores indicate that the specific topic being discussed is causing significant psychological stress, often pointing to deception or concealed information.
**Key Terminology:**
• DRS (Deception Rating Scale): A numerical value assigned to a behavior indicating its correlation with stress or deception.
• Cluster: A group of behaviors occurring simultaneously or in close succession in response to a single stimulus.
• Confirming Gestures: Behaviors that support the interpretation of the primary gesture observed.
• Conflicting Behaviors: Behaviors that contradict the primary gesture, suggesting a different interpretation.
**Common Mistakes:**
• "Spotting" a single behavior (e.g., arm crossing) and assuming deception without looking for a cluster or calculating the score.
• Failing to account for the subject's baseline behavior.
**Application Example:** During an interview, when asked about a missing file, the subject crosses their arms (Acc, 2.0), compresses their lips (Lc, 4.0), and performs a single-sided shoulder shrug (Ss, 4.0). The total score is 10.0. While just under the 11.0 threshold, this high cluster indicates extreme stress regarding that specific topic, signaling the interviewer to probe deeper.
