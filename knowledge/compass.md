## The Behavior Compass (Plotting)
**Category:** Compass (The Behavior Compass)
**One-Line Definition:** A visual hexagon tool used to plot a subject's psychological profile, including Needs, Decisions, Values, Sensory Preferences, and Pronoun usage, to predict behavior and tailor influence.
**Core Principles:**
• Visual Aggregation: Combining multiple profiling data points into a single visual reference allows for rapid decision-making in real-time interactions.
• Hierarchical Layout: The Compass is structured with Values at the top (long-term drivers), Needs in the upper left (social drivers), and Decisions in the upper right (filtering mechanics).
**How It Works:** The Compass is drawn as a hexagon. The operator circles specific abbreviations corresponding to observations:
• Top Line (VAL): The Values Map (CON, INF, REC, EXP, FRE, GRO).
• Upper-Left (NDS): The Needs Map (SIG, APP, ACC, INT, PIT, STR).
• Upper-Right (DEC): The Decision Map (DEV, NOV, SOC, CON, INV, NEC).
• Lower-Left (SNS/PRN): Sensory Preference (Vis, Aud, Kin) and Pronouns (Self, Team, Others).
• Lower-Right (HND/LOC): Handedness (R/L) and Locus of Control (Int/Ext).
• Bottom (STR): Stress indicators (Lips, Blink Rate, Shoulders, Digits). By circling the observed traits, the operator creates a "map" that dictates exactly how to speak, move, and persuade the subject.
**Key Terminology:**
• Fuzzy Compass: A profiling technique where the operator notes the most likely trait and a secondary "backup" trait to account for uncertainty.
• GHT Arrows: Arrows inside the compass indicating which direction the subject looks to access positive information.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Filling out the compass based on what the subject says about themselves rather than how they behave toward others; self-description is often aspirational, not actual.
**Application Example:** An operator sketching a compass for a CEO circles STR (Strength Need), INV (Investment Decision), and FRE (Freedom Value). This tells the operator to speak with deference but frame the pitch as a tool for long-term liberation from daily tasks.
