## The Workspace & Medical Lab (Avery)
**Category:** 22. Hypnosis (Trance & suggestion)
**One-Line Definition:** A hypnotic construction of a mental "headquarters" containing specific rooms for controlling memory, emotion, and physiology.
**Core Principles:**
• Somatic Visualization: Bridging the gap between mental imagery and physiological response.
• The Admin Computer: A metaphorical device installed in the mind to edit memories, delete limiting beliefs, and adjust emotional regulation.
**How It Works:** Over a four-day protocol, the operator guides the client into a deep trance to construct a persistent mental environment. This includes an "Office" with a control computer for editing the psyche, and a "Medical Laboratory." In the lab, the client visualizes high-tech scanners and surgical equipment.
The client is trained to use this lab to "operate" on themselves—slowing their heart rate, healing injuries, or altering pain reception. This leverages the placebo effect and psychoneuroimmunology to create tangible physical changes.
**Key Terminology:**
• The Chamber: The specific room within the Workspace where the Avery personality construct is built and housed.
• The Medical Lab: A visualization tool for inducing physiological changes (temperature, heart rate, pain control).
**Common Mistakes:**
• Rushing the construction of the rooms; the client must vividly hallucinate the textures, smells, and lighting for the neural pathways to solidify.
**Application Example:** A client suffering from chronic anxiety enters their mental "Office," sits at the desk, opens the "Emotion" file on the computer, and manually dials down the "Fear" slider from an 8 to a 2, feeling an immediate physiological drop in cortisol.

## Fractionation
**Category:** 22. Hypnosis (Trance & suggestion)
**One-Line Definition:** A deepening technique that involves rapidly bringing a subject in and out of trance multiple times, with each re-induction creating a profoundly deeper state than the last.
**Core Principles:**
• Reset Depth: The brain plunges deeper into relaxation when re-induced after a brief moment of alertness.
• Resistance Fatigue: Repeatedly crossing the threshold of trance wears down psychological resistance.
**How It Works:** The operator induces a trance state, then instructs the subject to open their eyes and "come back" to the room (waking up). After a few seconds of alertness, the operator immediately re-induces the trance (often with a keyword like "Sleep").
This process is repeated several times. It is described as "pumping" the subject down the stairs of relaxation. It is particularly useful for subjects who are resistant or have trouble reaching deep levels of somnambulism on the first try.
**Key Terminology:**
• Fractionation: Dividing the hypnotic induction into smaller parts to campound the effect.
• Re-induction: The act of placing a subject back into trance immediately after waking them.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Leaving the subject "awake" for too long between inductions; the brain must not fully reset to beta wave alertness before being sent back down.
**Application Example:** "Open your eyes, wide awake. (Subject opens eyes). That's right. And... SLEEP. (Subject closes eyes). Going twice as deep now. Open your eyes. And... SLEEP. Ten times deeper."

## The Picnic Table Protocol
**Category:** 22. Hypnosis (Trance & suggestion)
**One-Line Definition:** A visualization exercise used in the Avery Protocol where the client meets their "younger self" to physically hand over limiting beliefs and traumas.
**Core Principles:**
• Somatic Release: Giving physical form (a bag) to abstract psychological burdens allows the brain to "drop" them.
• Inner Child Integration: confronting the source of limiting beliefs (the child) to negotiate their release.
**How It Works:** Under deep trance (Avery Day 3), the client is guided to a grassy hill with a picnic table and a bridge. They meet their younger self (child), who is carrying a heavy bag. The bag contains all the limiting beliefs and traumas the adult is still carrying.
The client discusses the contents of the bag with the child, realizes the child cannot cross the bridge to "adulthood" with the heavy bag, and negotiates to take the bag from them. The client then burns the bag in a fire pit, physically releasing the neurological hold of those beliefs.
**Key Terminology:**
• The Bridge: A metaphor for the transition from childhood trauma to adult freedom.
• The Bag: A visualization container for limiting beliefs.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Rushing the interaction between the adult and child; the emotional transfer of the "bag" must be felt viscerally for the neural pathways to reset.
**Application Example:** A client struggling with impostor syndrome meets their 7-year-old self, takes the "bag" of insecurity the child is holding, burns it, and watches the child run happily across the bridge, resulting in an immediate feeling of lightness in the present.

## The Cabinet of Counselors
**Category:** 22. Hypnosis (Trance & suggestion)
**One-Line Definition:** A visualization exercise where the subject constructs a mental conference room populated by historical figures, mentors, or fictional characters who provide wisdom and advice.
**Core Principles:**
• Dissociative Wisdom: Accessing one's own subconscious knowledge by projecting it onto an external avatar.
• The Master Mind Principle: Leveraging the psychological effect of "consulting" with a group of experts to gain confidence and clarity.
**How It Works:** The client is guided into a trance and brought into their mental "Workspace." They enter a "Conference Room" where they have previously selected 5-7 "counselors"—people they admire (living or dead, real or fictional). The client sits at the head of the table.
When faced with a dilemma, the client mentally asks a specific counselor for advice. The client's brain, unburdened by their own ego or insecurities, generates an answer in the voice and persona of that counselor. This allows the client to access wisdom they already possess but cannot access due to self-doubt.
**Key Terminology:**
• Invisible Counselors: The avatars created in the mind to represent specific virtues or knowledge.
• The Conference Room: The mental location within the Workspace where these meetings take place.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Choosing counselors the client finds intimidating rather than supportive; the figures must be allies.
**Application Example:** A client struggling with a tough business decision enters their mental conference room and asks "Steve Jobs" for advice on innovation. Their mind generates a solution they hadn't considered, framed in the direct, bold style they associate with Jobs.
