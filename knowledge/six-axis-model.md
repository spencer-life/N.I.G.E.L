## The Six-Axis Model of Influence
**Category:** Six-Axis
**One-Line Definition:** A diagnostic and strategic framework identifying the six essential factors—Focus, Suggestibility, Openness, Connection, Compliance, and Expectancy—that influence human behavior and decision-making.
**Core Principles:**
• All six factors are important, but only three need to be present at high levels to achieve successful persuasion.
• The model serves as both a planning tool for future interactions and a post-mortem tool to diagnose past failures.
• Every influence technique or tactic ultimately aims to measure or modify one of these six axes.
**How It Works:** The Six-Axis Model breaks down the complex process of influence into six modifiable variables. An operator uses this model to "read" the current state of a subject and then applies specific behavioral or linguistic techniques to "level up" specific axes. The model is dynamic; these characteristics change constantly based on environmental factors and the operator's behavior.
Different scenarios require prioritizing different axes. For example, in a short-term interaction like a speed date or asking for a free coffee, Focus is often the priority because time is limited. In a therapeutic setting, Openness is the priority to allow for vulnerability. In interrogation, Compliance takes precedence.
The model provides a map for the operator. If an interaction isn't working, the operator checks the axes. Is the subject focused? Are they open? Do they feel a connection? By identifying the low axis, the operator knows exactly which psychological lever to pull next.
**Key Terminology:**
• Focus: The degree to which a person maintains attention on a single source, excluding distractions.
• Suggestibility: The degree to which a person accepts and acts on suggestions from others.
• Openness: Comfort with vulnerability and a lack of fear regarding social repercussions.
• Connection: The level of social rapport and the desire for continued interaction.
• Compliance: The likelihood of a person following a specific request or direction.
• Expectancy: The conscious or unconscious prediction of a fulfilling or enjoyable outcome.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Attempting to level up all six axes simultaneously rather than prioritizing based on the specific scenario (e.g., prioritizing Connection when Compliance is needed).
• Failing to use the model as a diagnostic tool when an interaction stalls or fails.
**Application Example:** A car salesperson notices a customer is looking at a vehicle but seems hesitant. The salesperson identifies that Expectancy is low. Instead of pushing for Compliance (signing the deal), the salesperson paints a vivid verbal picture of the customer driving the car on a summer road trip, thereby increasing Expectancy of a positive future outcome, which naturally raises Suggestibility.

## Focus (Six-Axis Model)
**Category:** Six-Axis
**One-Line Definition:** The degree to which a person maintains attention on a single source or idea while successfully filtering out competing stimuli and distractions.
**Core Principles:**
• Focus is the "gateway" to all influence; without attention, no other axis matters.
• It functions differently in the "Human" brain (deliberate attention) versus the "Animal" brain (threat/novelty detection).
• In short-term interactions (like sales or speed dating), Focus is often the highest priority axis.
**How It Works:** Focus is the measure of a subject's attentional capacity. In the Six-Axis Model, it refers to the conscious allocation of mental resources to the operator. The brain’s Reticular Activating System (RAS) acts as a filter, deciding what information gets through to the conscious mind. To level up Focus, an operator must bypass this filter.
Operators increase Focus by using Novelty (breaking patterns), Authority (which demands attention), and Descriptive Language (which engages the visual cortex). When a subject is highly focused, they enter a state of "Attentional Captivity," where time seems to distort and distractions fade away. This state is essential for hypnosis and deep persuasion because it prevents the subject’s critical factor from analyzing outside information.
**Key Terminology:**
• Attentional Captivity: A state where the subject is so engrossed that they ignore environmental stimuli.
• Reticular Activating System (RAS): The part of the brainstem that filters incoming sensory data; the "gatekeeper" of focus.
• Novelty: The quality of being new or unexpected; the fastest way to trigger the RAS and generate Focus.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Mistaking "looking at you" for true Focus; a subject can be looking while thinking about dinner.
• Boring the subject with facts (Electric) instead of using stories (Chemical/Visual) to hold attention.
**Application Example:** An operator notices a client checking their watch. The operator stops mid-sentence, lowers their voice to a whisper, and says, "This next part is the secret that nobody talks about." This change in tone (Novelty) and the promise of a secret instantly re-engages the client's RAS, spiking the Focus axis back to high levels.

## Suggestibility (Six-Axis Model)
**Category:** Six-Axis
**One-Line Definition:** The degree to which a person is willing to accept and act upon the ideas, commands, or directives offered by an operator without critical resistance.
**Core Principles:**
• Suggestibility is not a fixed personality trait; it is a fluid state that changes based on environment and authority.
• It is inversely related to anxiety and the feeling of "needing to protect oneself."
• High suggestibility is physically observable (e.g., lower eyelid relaxation).
**How It Works:** Suggestibility is the "openness to input." It relies on the subject suspending their critical judgment. Factors that increase suggestibility include Authority (we naturally follow leaders), Fatigue (sleep deprivation lowers resistance), and Cognitive Load (confusion makes the brain grab the first clear suggestion).
In neuroscience terms, suggestibility involves connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex (conflict monitoring) and the prefrontal cortex. When an operator establishes trust or authority, the brain’s "threat detection" (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) quiets down, allowing suggestions to pass directly into action or belief.
**Key Terminology:**
• Critical Factor: The mental "security guard" that screens incoming information for truth or danger.
• Hypnotic Suggestibility: The specific capacity to respond to hypnotic commands; often measured by physical tests (e.g., "magnetic fingers").
• Lower Eyelid Factor (LEF): A physical indicator where a smooth, unwrinkled lower eyelid correlates with higher natural suggestibility.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Confusing Suggestibility with Compliance; a person may follow an order (Compliance) while secretly disagreeing with it (Low Suggestibility).
• Attempting to give direct suggestions before establishing Authority or Rapport.
**Application Example:** A doctor (Authority) tells a patient, "This pill will start removing the pain within ten minutes." Because the patient views the doctor as an expert and feels safe in the clinic (Context), their Suggestibility is high. The brain creates a placebo response, actually reducing pain signals based on the suggestion alone.

## Openness (Six-Axis Model)
**Category:** Six-Axis
**One-Line Definition:** The level of comfort a subject feels with vulnerability and the absence of fear regarding social judgment or repercussions.
**Core Principles:**
• Openness is the antidote to social masks; it allows for the sharing of secrets, fears, and true desires.
• It is triggered by "Informational Altruism" (the operator sharing first).
• Essential for therapy, deep rapport, and identifying a subject's Needs/Values.
**How It Works:** Humans naturally guard their true thoughts to protect their social standing (The Tribe). To level up Openness, an operator must create a "judgment-free zone." This is often achieved through Negative Dissociation (criticizing judgmental people to show you aren't one of them) or Identity Hacking (telling the subject, "You seem like someone who is really open").
When Openness is high, the subject will voluntarily offer information without being asked. This allows the operator to gather intelligence (6MX profiling) that is otherwise inaccessible.
**Key Terminology:**
• Social Mask: The curated persona people present to the world to ensure acceptance; Openness removes this mask.
• Informational Altruism: A technique where the operator shares a vulnerable personal detail to trigger reciprocity and Openness in the subject.
• Judgment: The primary killer of Openness; "You judge, you lose."
**Common Mistakes:**
• Asking probing questions before the subject feels safe; this lowers Openness and raises defenses.
• Acting shocked or judgmental when the subject reveals sensitive information.
**Application Example:** An operator wants a coworker to admit to a mistake. Instead of interrogating, the operator says, "I used to be so terrified of making mistakes that I'd hide them, and it ate me up inside. I feel like you're the kind of person who gets that." The coworker, feeling safe and validated, admits, "Yeah, I actually messed up the report yesterday."

## Connection (Six-Axis Model)
**Category:** Six-Axis
**One-Line Definition:** The depth of the social bond between operator and subject, characterized by a feeling of similarity, shared experience, and a desire for future interaction.
**Core Principles:**
• Connection is chemically driven by oxytocin and dopamine.
• People connect with those who reflect their own identity, values, or pronouns (Self/Team/Others).
• Connection creates a "Truth Bias," where the subject assumes the operator is honest.
**How It Works:** Connection is the "glue" of influence. It moves an interaction from a transaction to a relationship. Operators build Connection by mirroring the subject’s Linguistic Patterns (using the same sensory words and pronouns) and validating their Needs (e.g., giving a "Significance" person attention).
When Connection is high, the subject feels "understood." This axis is vital for long-term influence, relationships, and situations where trust is more important than facts (e.g., getting a favor).
**Key Terminology:**
• Oxytocin: The "bonding hormone" released during moments of trust, touch, and connection.
• Homophily: The tendency for individuals to associate and bond with similar others ("birds of a feather").
• Truth Bias: The cognitive bias where we are less likely to detect deception from people we feel connected to.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Faking commonalities (e.g., "I love golf too!") which breaks trust if discovered.
• Focusing on Connection when the situation requires Authority or Compliance (e.g., a police stop).
**Application Example:** A salesperson identifies that a client uses "Team" pronouns ("We need a car that fits us"). The salesperson stops saying, "What you need," and starts saying, "What’s going to work best for the family?" The client feels a sudden, deep sense of Connection because the salesperson is speaking their "language."

## Compliance (Six-Axis Model)
**Category:** Six-Axis
**One-Line Definition:** The willingness of a subject to follow directions, execute commands, or adhere to the operator's requests.
**Core Principles:**
• Compliance is a habit; small acts of obedience lead to larger ones (The "Yes Ladder").
• It is driven heavily by Authority and the fear of social friction.
• Behavioral Entrainment (controlling physical movement) is a shortcut to psychological compliance.
**How It Works:** Compliance is the "action" axis. It is not about how much the person likes you (Connection), but how likely they are to obey you. Operators build Compliance by issuing small, low-stakes commands ("Check this out," "Step over here," "Hold this") early in the interaction.
This establishes a pattern of obedience. In high-stakes environments (like interrogation), Compliance is the most critical axis. It is often achieved by limiting the subject's choices or using "Double Binds" (e.g., "Do you want to sit now or in a minute?" - either way, they sit).
**Key Terminology:**
• Behavioral Entrainment: The process of guiding a subject’s physical movements to create a subconscious pattern of following the operator.
• The "Yes" Set: A series of questions or commands designed to get affirmative responses, building momentum toward a final request.
• Double Bind: A linguistic trap where two options are offered, but both lead to the operator's desired outcome.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Asking for a major commitment (the sale/confession) before establishing a pattern of small compliance.
• Using a questioning tone ("Could you please...?") instead of a directive tone ("Go ahead and...") when Authority is needed.
**Application Example:** Before asking for a date, an operator asks the subject to "hold this drink for a second" and "look at that picture on the wall." The subject complies with both. Having established a subconscious pattern of Compliance, the operator then says, "Put your number in my phone," and the subject obeys automatically.

## Expectancy (Six-Axis Model)
**Category:** Six-Axis
**One-Line Definition:** The subject’s internal prediction of a future outcome, which acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy and drives current behavior.
**Core Principles:**
• The brain constantly simulates the future; influencing this simulation controls present behavior.
• High Expectancy creates a dopamine release before the event actually happens.
• It is the primary mechanic behind the Placebo Effect.
**How It Works:** Expectancy is the "vision" axis. It leverages the brain's inability to distinguish vividly imagined events from reality. Operators level up Expectancy by using Future Pacing (describing the future as if it is happening now) and Scarcity (creating fear of missing a future benefit).
If a subject expects a procedure to be painless, their brain releases natural painkillers. If a customer expects a product to change their life, they buy it. The operator’s goal is to paint a vivid, inevitable picture of the desired future.
**Key Terminology:**
• Future Pacing: A linguistic technique where the operator guides the subject to imagine a future scenario where the desired change has already occurred.
• Placebo Effect: A physiological or psychological change resulting purely from the patient's belief (expectancy) in a treatment.
• Dopamine: The neurotransmitter of "anticipation" and "pursuit," driven by Expectancy.
**Common Mistakes:**
• Describing the future in vague terms ("It'll be good") rather than vivid, sensory details ("You'll feel the warm sun on your face...").
• Failing to build Expectancy before asking for a decision.
**Application Example:** A trainer tells an athlete, "Tomorrow, you’re going to feel a burst of energy like never before because of this workout." The next day, the athlete performs at a personal best. The workout didn't change; the Expectancy created a physiological response (adrenaline/dopamine) that fueled the performance.
